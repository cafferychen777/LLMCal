- **Ambiguous dates**: "next week" (which day?)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### PopClip Doesn't Appear
1. **Check if PopClip is running**: Look for icon in menu bar
2. **Try selecting text again**: Sometimes takes a moment
3. **Check accessibility permissions**: System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility

### "Invalid API Key" Error
1. **Double-check the key**: Should start with `sk-ant-`
2. **No extra spaces**: Copy-paste carefully
3. **Key still active**: Check at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### Events Not Appearing in Calendar
1. **Check calendar permissions**: PopClip needs calendar access
2. **Restart Calendar app**: Sometimes helps with sync issues
3. **Check correct calendar**: Events might be in different calendar

### Text Not Recognized
1. **Be more specific**: "Team meeting Monday 2pm" vs "meeting Monday"
2. **Include duration**: "for 1 hour" or "30 minutes"
3. **Try shorter text**: Very long paragraphs might confuse AI
