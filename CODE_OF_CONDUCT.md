# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and participants.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. Appropriate and fair corrective action may be taken in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a private security advisory or contacting the maintainers.

- Report a vulnerability or sensitive issue: GitHub → Security → Advisories
- Otherwise, open an issue with the appropriate template

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
